# Bellabeat Case Study: Smart Device Usage Analysis

**Business objective:** Identify trends in smart device usage to guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy for the Leaf wellness tracker.

## Key Findings

- **Engagement varies widely** — median tracking duration of 39 days, but 11% of days show zero activity (device not worn)
- **Users prioritize lifestyle movement** — 37.6% achieve moderate activity (5-10k steps), dominated by light activity rather than intense workouts
- **Sleep tracking underutilized** — only 68% of activity users logged sleep data, with just 32% of activity days including sleep records
- **Routines stay consistent** — minimal difference between weekday and weekend behaviour (~8,268 vs 8,178 steps)

## Recommendations

1. Position Leaf as a device designed for **long-term habit formation**.
2. Target **“lifestyle wellness”** users rather than fitness enthusiasts.
3. Promote **sleep tracking** as a core feature.
4. **Emphasise consistency** and routine rather than lifestyle transformation.
5. Encourage moderate daily movement through **personalised nudges**.
